A dog grooming store is looking to implement a software system to manage their services. They
want you to create a prototype system in Java in two phases. In the first phase you will create a
set of interacting Java classes for representing the Groomer, Client, Dog, Service and
Booking. In the second phase you will create a GUI interface.
In the first stage, you will create and test the following Java classes.
• A class named Client that will encapsulate information relating to the client.

• A class named Dog that will encapsulate information relating to the dog that belongs to a
client.
• An enumerated type called DogBreed to indicate the breed of a dog.
• A class called Service and subclasses called GroomingService,
TrainingService and CleaningService that will encapsulate information and
details about different types of services.
• A class called Booking to encapsulate a Client, a Service and a date time, a booking is
made for one client who select one service.
• A class called BookingUtils to implement the bill calculation.
• A class called DogGrooming to demonstrate the functionality that allows the user to
o Create a new client, dog or service.
o Create a booking.
o Update client, dog or service details.
o Calculate the bill.
In the second stage you will design and implement a GUI that makes use of the hierarchy of
interacting classes described above and the Goomer class (provided). The GUI should incorporate
functionality that allows the user to:
• List existing Groomers, view details of a selected groomer and create new groomers.
• List existing clients and dogs; create new/update clients and dogs.
• List existing services; create new/update service.
• Select a client and a service to create a booking.
